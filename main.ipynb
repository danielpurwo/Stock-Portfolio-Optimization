It covers these topics: stock investment background and understanding the Sectors API, stock selection overview and two stock portfolio optimization models, followed by further recommendations and insights.\n",

    "Using the Sectors API, investors gain access to valuable data from the “**Companies by Index**” and “**Daily Transaction Data**” endpoints, including stock indexes, dates, closing prices, volumes, and market capitalizations. Next, the “**Company Report**” API provides additional insights such as EPS, dividends, growth metrics, and other relevant financial information.\n",

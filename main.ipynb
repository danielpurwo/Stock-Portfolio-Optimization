    "Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Monte Carlo Simulation provides a diversified portfolio with a balanced approach to risk and return, while the Scipy Optimization approach is more aggressive, concentrating investments in fewer stocks with higher expected returns but also slightly increased volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the Scipy optimization yields better risk-adjusted returns (higher Sharpe ratio) and expected returns, making it a more favorable strategy in this context. However, the Monte Carlo simulation’s results reflect a more cautious approach to diversification that may suit risk-averse investors."
